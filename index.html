        <blockquote> ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</blockquote>

        <blockquote>‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
          gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable

        <h3>Such a life-changing <br> experience. Highly <br> recommended!</h3>
        <blockquote>‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed  some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming  step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not  disappoint. They were very hands-on  I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took  my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommend! ‚Äù</blockquote>
